Dizzy Duck
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 18 2024

A very dizzy duck stumbles into a dark scary forest. 

## Theme
We implemented the reverse theme in multiple aspects of the game. One way is by switching the traditional A and D keys used to control a player's movement left and right respectively. It is now opposite, or reversed, with the D key controlling left movement and the A key controlling right movement. We also included music within our game that is played in reverse to add to the theme. Our largest implementation of the reverse theme within our game is through the storyline. The main player character is a cute duck who is in a very dark, creepy, and spooky forest setting filled with scary monsters and frightening decor. We have reversed the usual story by having the cute innocent duck be the character who is navigating this treacherous land and defeating horrifying monsters. Whereas people usually would expect a strong, mighty hero or even a more evil character to take on this conquest, we have implemented the reverse theme by making our hero player a cute innocent duck who defeats scary beasts.

## Game Play
Objective: Get the dizzy duck safely through the dark forest while collecting coins and avoiding enemies.
Game-play instructions: Play as the dizzy duck using the A and D keys for movement and the space bar for jumping. Collect coins to increase your score and reach the sign at the edge of the forest to complete the level.

## Impediments
The process of importing different tile sets and configuring the correct sizing for the game was a slight challenge. However, we were able to work through the tileset setup process and have correctly functioning assets. Additionally, we had to go back into some of the enemy code previously set up to make a few changes in order to get the enemy movement to function correctly within the game.

## Implementation
Multiple imported tilesets. 
Multiple enemies with different behaviors.
Music for scenes.
Cohesive theme and storyline.
Demon Panic Font.
Hand-designed Player and Enemy pixel art.
Hand-designed Start and End scene menu backgrounds and button art.

Created using Unity 2022.3.17f1
